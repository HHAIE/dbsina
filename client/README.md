Would you rather game App

# Installation: 
Fork and clone the repository, cd into 'would-you-rather' folder and run 'npm install' or 'yarn add', then run 'npm start' or 'yarn start'

# Usage:
When First accessing the app the user would be asked to sign in as one of the available users, then would be redirected to the main page.
From the main page you can check all the created questions organized into two tabs answered and unanswered, depending on if the current user has answered them or not yet.
By clicking on any question the user would be redirected to the question page either to answer it or view the stats of the question if it is already answered by the user.
There is a nav bar that appears on top of all pages except the sign in page.
From the nav bar the user can navigate to the home page, create new question page, leaderboard page, or sign out to switch user. The data of the current user is also available in the nav bar.
The leaderboard page shows the stats of each user.
